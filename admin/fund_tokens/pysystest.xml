        <title>Allocate OBX tokens from the deployment account across bridge</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
        Uses the pre-funded deployment account as the owner of the OBX ERC20 tokens to transfer tokens to the
        bridge account in L1. This will then be synced across to the L2 OBX ERC20 token contract and made available to
        the deployment account there. In effect the deployment account is being used as a faucet of tokens to be
        available to users of Obscuro. The transfer of tokens will only be done if we are below a threshold limit in L2.
