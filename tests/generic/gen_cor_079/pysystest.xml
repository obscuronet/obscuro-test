        <title>Events: concurrent javascript client using eth.subscribe on logs</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[]]>
This is the third of three ways to get event logs for a contract event that is emitted. It is a subscription
approach where eth.subscribe is used on the web3 instance, and the topic to filter on is the keccak256 of the event
signature. The storage contract is used which emits a single event with an integer value (no addresses) and so should
be visible to any interested parties within Obscuro. As a subscription it uses websockets for the connection protocol.
